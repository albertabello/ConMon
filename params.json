ConMon passively monitors the IP packets and classifies them to measure the bit rate for each of the classifiers. It is based on the [Sniffer example](http://www.tcpdump.org/sniffex.c) in `libpcap (tcpdump)`.\r\n\r\nFor more information read the [project README.md](https://github.com/vr000m/ConMon/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Current classifiers:\r\n* Total, TCP, UDP, local, external [done]\r\n* Each is further classified as combined, inbound, outbound and background [done]\r\n* Additionally: can detect RTP/UDP (if no hint is available on which port the \r\nRTP is received then there are still some false-positives).\r\n\r\n#### Extras (yet to be implemented)\r\n* IPv4 and IPv6\r\n* STUN packets\r\n* HTTP(S): port 80 and 443\r\n* LEDBAT: e.g., Bittorrent\r\n\r\n### Example Results\r\n\r\nA few sample results have been added to the \r\n[Wiki](https://github.com/vr000m/ConMon/wiki/Example-Results)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contribute/Extend\r\nIf you want to parse a packet look at got_packet() there is a switch case\r\nthat parses the protocol field. You can add your own code or function to\r\nparse the associated packet (see `ParseUDPPacket()`/`ParseTCPPacket()` in\r\n`conmon.c`).","google":"UA-239293-1"}
