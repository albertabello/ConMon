
Compiling:
The project comes with a basic Makefile. If your system does not have
libpcap installed you can download it from [TCPDUMP]. 

[Note 1]: If you are compiling on linux, it is likely you will have to
change:
iph->ip_len = (IPTCPHDRSIZE);
to
iph->ip_len = htons(IPTCPHDRSIZE);

[Note 2]: If you want to capture some other types of packets (e.g., IP,
ICMP, UDP) then change the filter expression in: 
char filter_exp[] = "(tcp[13] == 0x10)"; 
to 
char filter_exp[] = "ip"; 
for capturing IP packets instead of TCP ACK packets (comments in code has
some examples)[WS_FILTERS].

[Note 3]: If you want to parse a packet look at got_packet() there is a
switch case that parses the protocol field. You can add your own code or
function to parse the packet.
