ConMon is a tool that will measure the traffic to and from an endpoint.

Current classifiers:
** local (inbound, outbound and background) [done]
** external (--same as above--) [done]
** IPv4 and IPv6?
** TCP and UDP [done]
*** port 80 and 443?

TODO:
* create above classifiers [done]
* hash the source/destination IP addresses.
* create vectors/map of bit rate for each of the above classifiers.
* create plots to show changes in bit rate for the above classifiers
* create an API so that applications can query the bit rate for a specific
  classifier

There may be bugs related to IPv6 in some places. ConMon is a fork from my
earlier project [Snapper]

Compiling:
The project comes with a basic Makefile. If your system does not have
libpcap installed you can download it from [TCPDUMP]. 


[Note 1]: If you want to parse a packet look at got_packet() there is a
switch case that parses the protocol field. You can add your own code or
function to parse the associated packet (see
ParseUDPPacket()/ParseTCPPacket()).
